# Rcode_Weibull_measurement_error_and_misclassification
The folders and the R code help to reproducing Tables 1-3 and Tables S1-S3 in the article "Weibull regression with both measurement error and misclassification in covariates" by Zhiqiang Cao and Man Yu Wong (under review).

For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zhiqiang Cao zcaoae@connect.ust.hk.
You will need to change the directory to use the example code in script R code. This folder includes the following functions:
1. score_fisher_setup_new.R: This program provide score and fisher (sandwich variance estimation) for weibull regression including both measurement error and misclassification rate

2. main_simulation_tables_1_2_S1_S2.R: this program can reproduce simulations results in Tables 1-2 in main text and Tables S1-S2 in supplementary material.

3. main_simulation_table3.R: This program can reproduce simulation results in Table 3 of main text.

4. supp_simulation_table_S3.R: This program can reproduce simulation results in Table S3 in supplementary material.
